Maybe I can actually make a presentation, but if it's in front of you, you can be sure my hands and feet are shaking hahaha. Because in my subconscious, I always want to appear perfect in front of you, which in the end, instead of being perfect, actually makes me nervous and make stupid mistakes (I don't know if this is a bad thing or a good thing hahaha).",

I always try to avoid you, not because I don't want to meet you, but because I can't. If you're near me, you can be sure that my heart rate will increase 3x faster üòÅ, even speaking becomes slurred.",

Someone who always acts like a complete idiot, but in his heart there is something he wants to express. I just want you to know, there is someone who loves you. ",
